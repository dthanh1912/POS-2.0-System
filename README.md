### Task 4:

### Task 5:

## Problems during execution
### Get the answer
- Context of project vs context model (Chapter 5 section 1)
    - Context of project is jus a common situation (we are heading the right way)
    - Context model -> use for different kind of diagram studied later in chapter 5
- What is the dashed line inside workflow diagram?
    - ----> (full line arrow): sequence of action, action happened right after another action
        - The customer order the meal, the clerk need to immediately confirm the order
    - \- \- \-> (dashed arrow): the action will happen, but **NOT** neccessarily immediate
        - For example, customer need to pay the order, but not right after placing order. Can pay after receiving the meal.
- What exactly is MVP? 
    - In the assignment, we need to make UI interface, including
        - Show the menu as shown in figure 2
        - When hitting the button icon `cart`, show the details description of meal as shown in figure 3
        - When user hit the button payment, create hyperlink to show payment screen (as shown in figure 4)
- What technology to implement MVP?
    - Right now, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is a good choice

### Did not get the answer
- What does table format of use-case diagram?
- In the task 1.2 diagram, `manage order` should extend by add food or delete food || `manage order` become CRUD example
